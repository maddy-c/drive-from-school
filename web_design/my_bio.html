	<p style='margin-right:25%; margin-left:25%'>My favorite food is <strong>egg</strong> because they're really good. Part of the reason that I really like eggs are because they are cheap and practical, and go with practically anything. Lots of delicious desserts contain eggs, such as cake, cupcakes, and pancakes, but eggs can also be a breakfast, lunch or dinner. Eggs are good by themselves, with seasoning, with different ingredients mixed in, or just by themselves! Plus, you can cook eggs in a lot of different ways, such as making an omelet, hard boiled eggs, soft boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, eggs on toast, sunny side up, and tons more! Overall, these are just some of the reasons why I really love eggs.
