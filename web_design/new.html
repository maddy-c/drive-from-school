<blockquote> This land is your land, this land is my land <br>
From the California to the New York island <br>
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters <br>
This land was made for you and me <br>
As I went walking that ribbon of highway <br>
I saw above me that endless skyway <br>
And saw below me that golden valley <br>
This land was made for you and me <br>
