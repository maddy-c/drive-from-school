<h1>Most damaging computer viruses</h1>
<p>Computer viruses are all over the Internet, and it seems even today after disasters like the Mydoom and the ILOVEYOU worm, and a recent outbreak garnering media attention of the WannaCry ransomware, people still aren't cautious enough of computer viruses. This list will be going over some of the most damaging, innovative, and infamous malware in recent history.</p>
<div id="main">
<ol>
	<li>
		<dl>
			<dt>CIH Virus</dt>
			<dd><p>The CIH virus, also known as Chernobyl, is notable as being the first ever computer virus to have the capability to corrupt a computer's BIOS ROM chip, and being one of the first viruses to take advantage of the blank space inside portable executable files, writing itself in the gaps of the code, with a reassembly sequence to piece itself together to deliver it's payload on April 26th, 1999. It was written by Chen Ing-hau from Taiwan.</p><p>The reason CIH spread so well was it's ability to hide in the gaps of executables, as opposed to the more common method of a virus writing itself to the end of a file (opposed to sitting as an independent file)- which was detected commonly by anti-virus at the time. Because of this undetectability, several thousand brand new IBM Aptivas were shipped with the worm on board just one month before the payload was set to trigger. When any executable is run with the CIH code in it, it will find other executables and infect them. So, it spread to many download servers, also notably hidden in a software update to a program by Yamaha.</p><p>The first part of it's payload is not particularly destructive; as it overwrites only the first megabyte on the hard drive with a string of zeros. This would mean the master boot record, disk volume record, and boot loader are lost; however user data is still present and the hard drive can be restored by replacing the MBR and boot sector. The rest of disk repair is done by scanning the drive to restore the partition table and the FAT file can be restored from the second copy on the drive. With enough technical knowledge, your hard drive can easily be fully restored.</p><p>However, it's second payload, which activates just after the first, is far more destructive- it rewrites the Flash ROM of the BIOS on select BIOS chips with junk data, completely breaking the POST process and making the computer completely unbootable. This, nowadays, can be repaired by replacing the BIOS chip on the motherboard, but this was an unheard of practice at the time and many people just assumed their computers doomed. Any computers with incompatible BIOS chips or UEFI chips were unaffected by this second payload.</p></dd>

		<dt>ILOVEYOU E-mail Virus</dt>
		<dd><p>Despite it's innocuous name, the ILOVEOU worm was nothing to joke about. The ILOVEYOU worm was one of the fastest spreading computer viruses, causing billions of dollars in damage, and at its peak an estimated 10% of all internet-connected computers were infected with the malicious program.</p><p>It spread through email, so when you were infected it would send a copy of itself to every address in your address book. It was opened and propagated through social engineering, with the title of the e-mail being "LOVE LETTER FOR YOU" and the contents being only it's Visual Basic script, which was cleverly disguised (taking advantage of how windows hides known file extensions on default) as a .txt file, so a user would be tricked into opening it out of curiosity. Back in the 2000's, malware was somewhat of a legend, and many people despite having heard about the virus' destructive capabilities, opened it anyway out of disbelief of the damage it would cause.</p><p>From there, the payload of the virus would wipe a victim's hard drive by replacing almost all common file types with a copy of itself, destroying all data on the hard drive with no way to recover it. An estimated 15 billion dollars was spent to remove the worm from computers across the world, and another 7 billion in damages from data loss.</dd>

	<dl>
		<dt>Mydoom </dt>
		<dd><p>Mydoom was the most widespread computer worm, smashing records set by the ILOVEYOU worm and it's records have yet to be broken in 2018.</p><p>It spread through e-mail, posing as an error report e-mail, prompting you to run the attached executable to recover the e-mail. After infection, it mails itself to all addresses in your address book, and scans files on the system for e-mail addresses to mail itself.</p><p>It's main payload contained code to organize a massive denial of service attack on February 1st, on the SCO Group company's website, likely due to their recent controversial statements about the Linux operating system, and other legal actions. However, only an estimated 1/4 computers successfully triggered the payload. Additionally, the SCO Group removed itself from the DNS a few hours before the attack was set to begin, minimizing damage.</p><p> The Mydoom worm also replaced a system file in system32 named SHIMGAPI.DLL with it's own version of the file, opening a backdoor in the computer as it ran as a child process of Windows Explorer.</p><p>When the first variant of the worm was released on January 26th, it quickly began to spread and within hours an estimated 1/10 emails was sent by Mydoom. After the second variant began to go viral on January 28th, that number increased to 1/5 emails having been sent by Mydoom, putting great stress on email networks. The first two variants of the worm stopped themselves from spreading on the 12th of February, and the 1st of March. However, even though the worm no longer did anything on your system, the backdoor it left open remains vulnerable.</p><p>On the 9th of February, a variant of the worm called Doomjuice began spreading through this backdoor, launching a massive DDOS attack against Microsoft. Due to the high load tolerance of Microsoft's servers, damage was minimal.</p><p>And finally, on the 26th of July, Mydoom returns with yet another variation, this time launching a DDOS against various search engines. The most notable of these was Google, which was down for most of the workday. Although in itself, it wasn't very destructive, the range of it's spread set records still unbroken and it deserves a place on this list for it's notability for that.</p></dd>

		<dt>Blaster</dt>
		<dd><p>Blaster, also known as LOVESAN, LOVSAN, or MSBLAST; was a worm sent with the intention of infecting a botnet to launch a DDOS against windowsupdate.com in August 2003, however, despite having been widespread, it didn't spread over e-mail. Instead, it exploited a vulnerability in the DCOM RPC (respectively Distributed Component Object Model and Remote Procedure Call) service.</p><p>The exploit was possible due to the drivers being able to manage higher permissions and a buffer overflow vulnerability in the RPC, so it was able to cause RPC to execute the exploit code from the virus and open a program for Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) by opening TFTPD.exe, and open port UDP port 69 for TFTP file transfer. This exploit had been patched in Windows a month earlier, but many computers hadn't yet updated, leaving them vulnerable to the attack.</p><p>It spread by attempting to spam 1 of two variants of the exploit code to random IPs on TCP port 135, which was the port RPC used which allowed the buffer overflow. There is an 80% chance the exploit code will be specific for Windows XP, and a 20% chance the exploit code will be for Windows 2000. However, if the exploit code sent does not match the system targeted, the RPC will error and cause either a system reboot or renders the system unresponsive dependent on the version of Windows the exploit was executed on.</p><p>If the exploit code is received successfully, the new computer receives the buffer overflow instructions for the RPC which was listening at port 135, and the exploit code tells the computer to listen for a command on TCP port 4444, and to open TFTPD.exe (which is used for simple file transfer). The infected computer asks if the destination is already infected over port 4444, and if not tells it to initialize a file transfer on UDP port 69 for TFTP to transfer the worm's executable over to the new computer as both computers now have the port open. The infected computer tells the target computer over port 4444 to run the worm. Both ports are closed on both machines after transfer is completed. The target computer runs the worm and repeats.</p><p>The Windows registry is also edited to prevent reinfection on a computer. The massive scale DDOS attack against windowsupdate.com began on August 16th, 2003, but was largely unsuccessful due to windowsupdate.com being nothing more than a redirect to windowsupdate.microsoft.com; which was not attacked.</p></dd>

		<dt>Sasser</dt>
		<dd><p>Sasser was a computer worm named after the executable it exploits to spread; similarly to how Blaster spread- but instead of exploiting a buffer overflow in the RPC, it instead exploits a buffer overflow in the LSASS component service.</p><p>It exploits primarily over TCP port 445, or rarely port 139. A patch had been released for the LSASS's buffer overflow vulnerability 17 days earlier, but most computers hadn't yet installed the update, leaving millions of computers open and vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p>First, on an infected machine Sasser will generate a random IP address, with a 1/4 chance of sharing components with the current IP address. It will send out the exploit code over Port 445 to check if a computer is running on that address, and if so, opens an FTP (file transfer protocol) file transfer server on the host computer, and the exploit code opens a remote shell host on the target computer. The remote shell host allows the destination computer to be remotely controlled. The host computer will initialize a FTP connection with the destination computer and transfer the worm to it, tell it to execute it over the remote shell host, then close the connection.</p><p>While Sasser did not have any negative payloads in of itself, it did cause many computers to significantly slow down or crash due to the computation consumed by generation of IP addresses to test, causing damage upwards of 1 billion USD. Some of the services swamped by the worm include airports, canceled airplane flights, a hospital's emergency Level 4 x-ray machines, and a Finnish bank had to close all 130 of their locations due to having been wrecked by the worm.</p></dd>
