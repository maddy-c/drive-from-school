			<h2>The Beginning: 1950's</h2>
			<p>The first video game was "Tennis for two", a simple game with two lines and a ball that you control to aim a ball across the net against another player.</p>

			<h2>Video Games at Home: 1960-80's</h2>
			<p>By the 80's, the arcade machines and huge computers formerly used to house video games were available easily at home, giving birth to a fast paced video game industry producing hundreds of games for all the popular consoles in hopes of earning some cash in the massive craze for video games.</p>

			<h2>North American Video Game Crash</h2>
			<p>In fact, there were so many video games being pumped out and produced at such a low quality, that people stopped buying them altogether as they were wasting all their money on games there were just recycles of the games they already had. A game for the Atari that was famous for being bad was ET, which was poorly made and nonsensical. This game is widely known for being the final nail in the coffin.</p>

			<h2>The Rise of Games in the East</h2>
			<p>Video games were also picking up popularity in Eastern countries like Japan. The creation of many of today's famous games began in Japan, with characters such as Mario <em>(Japanese character)</em> and Kirby having been created originally in Japan before taking off with equal popularity in the US.</p>

			<h2>Tech Company Takeover</h2>

Companies like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Samsung, Apple, and others were getting more popular by the day, and the speed of development of newer consoles and home computers skyrocketed. By the early 2000's, everybody knew of the big tech names such as Microsoft, Apple, Nintendo, and others.</p>
			<br>
